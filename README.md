# Moltin Example
Example app I created for a eCommerce Meetup Jun 13, 2018.

This demo app was done on version 2 of Moltin. They are now on version 3. The syntax is somewhat the same. I would suggest using Moltin version 3 to get the lastest version. They have an example app that you can also use. It has iOS, TvOS and Apple watch.

# Installation
The first thing you want to do is go to [Moltin](https://dashboard.moltin.com/signup) and sign up to get your client_id and public_key. 
Git clone the project and add a Keys.plist file to you project and insert your Client_ID keys.
